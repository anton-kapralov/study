/**
 * This problem was inspired by a board game called Hex, designed independently by Piet Hein and
 * John Nash. It has a similar idea, but does not assume you have played Hex.
 *
 * <p>This game is played on an NÃ—N board, where each cell is a hexagon. There are two players: Red
 * side (using red stones) and Blue side (using blue stones). The board starts empty, and the two
 * players take turns placing a stone of their color on a single cell within the overall playing
 * board. Each player can place their stone on any cell not occupied by another stone of any color.
 * There is no requirement that a stone must be placed beside another stone of the same color. The
 * player to start first is determined randomly (with equal probability among the two players).
 *
 * <p>The upper side and lower sides of the board are marked as red, and the other two sides are
 * marked as blue. For each player, the goal of the game is to connect the two sides marked with
 * their color by forming a connected path using stones of their color. The first player to achieve
 * this wins. Note that the four corners are considered connected to both colors.
 *
 * <p>The game ends immediately when one player wins.
 *
 * <p>Given a game state, help someone new to the game determine the status of a game board. Say one
 * of the following:
 *
 * <p>Impossible: If it was impossible for two players to follow the rules and to have arrived at
 * that game state. Red wins: If the player playing the red stones has won. Blue wins: If the player
 * playing the blue stones has won. Nobody wins: If nobody has yet won the game. Note that a game of
 * Hex cannot end without a winner! Note that in any impossible state, the only correct answer is
 * Impossible, even if red or blue has formed a connected path of stones linking the opposing sides
 * of the board marked by their colors.
